	2> Go

* Steps to Apply Migration(Code first approach):

To run the test cases in CMD, Run the following command to test the application:

	(e-library/dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed")
 (You can run this command multiple times to identify the test case status,and   refactor code  to make maximum test cases passed before final submission).

* To ensure your code is saved and available for later use, remember to use the CTRL+Shift+B command on your code IDE.
   This will push or save the updated contents in the internal git/repository.
   It is also important to use CTRL+Shift+B before the final submission to evaluate the code quality.
